Hello !

1_ My friend, I am tired of these files

2_ If the first file (spasm.py) does not work for you

#I got tired and made a copy of the file (spasm1.py)

#And it works without some extra packages

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

1_ gooo run the file 'spasm.sh' not 'spasm.py'

now go run the file 'spasm.py' or 'sp.py'

if the file 'spasm.py' not work go and run file

'spasm1.py

how to run ?? :

1_  goo to terminal or gust enter 'bash spasm.sh'

2_  goo again and enter 'python spasm.py' if not work

goo and enter 'python spasm1.py'

Or you can run the file (sp.py) if you want
